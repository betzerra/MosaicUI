# Mosaic UI
**IMPORTANT: I'm developing a new UI very similar to MosaicUI based on UICollectionView. Take a look at https://github.com/betzerra/MosaicLayout**

**MosaicUI** is a tiled UI for iOS that automatic layouts according to the elements' sizes.

## DataSource Delegate
To work properly, **MosaicView** needs a class that implements **MosaicViewDatasourceProtocol** 
```objc
-(NSArray *)mosaicElements; // Array containing MosaicData objects
```

## MosaicViewDelegate
Ok, so now you've got the **MosaicView** working but you'll probably want something to happen when someone taps an element. In that case you'll need a class that implements **MosaicViewDelegateProtocol**

```objc
-(void)mosaicViewDidTap:(MosaicDataView *)aModule;
-(void)mosaicViewDidDoubleTap:(MosaicDataView *)aModule;
```

## Look and feel
You can customize how it looks by overriding the **MosaicDataView** class.

## Feedback is welcome
Help me to improve **MosaicUI** and tell me what do you think about it
